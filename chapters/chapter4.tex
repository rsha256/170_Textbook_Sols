\begin{problem}{4.16}
\textbf{Find the parent/child indices of an array-based binary heap.}
\\
The parent of node $j$ is at $\lfloor{j}/2\rfloor$; the children are at $2j$ and $2j + 1$.
\\
\textbf{Find the parent/child indices of an array-based $d$-ary heap.}
\\
The parent of node $j$ is at $\lfloor{(j - 1) / d}\rfloor$; its children are $dj + 1, dj + 2, ..., d(j + 1)$.
\\
\textbf{Show that a heap can be constructed in $O(n)$ time.}
\\
Use bottom-up heapification: start from the bottom and bubble down each node that is in the incorrect position. This takes $n / 2 * 1$ work on the bottom level, $n / 4 * 2$ work on the second level, and so on, until $\log n$ work on the top level. Thus, the runtime is 
    \[
        n / 2 + n / 4 * 2 + ... + n / n * log n
    \]
    \[
        = \sum_{i = 0}^{\log n} i \frac{n}{2^{i + 1}}
    \]
    \[
        = n/2 * \sum_{i = 0}^{\log n} \frac{i}{2^i}
    \]
    \[
        = n/2 * \sum_{i = 0}^{\log n} i * (\frac{1}{2})^i)
    \]
    \[
        \leq n/2 * \frac{1/2}{(1 - 1/2)^2}
    \]
    \[
        = n \in \Theta(n)
    \]
\textbf{How would you adapt \texttt{makeheap} to d-ary heaps?}
\\ 
Change the indices of the child/parent.
